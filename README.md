# Ferret site

link: https://septillion24.github.io/ferret-site/

I created this site as a side project to work on outside of class for fun. This uses Svelte because it had been a while since I worked with any framework and I've been hearing many good things about it and it has been gaining popularity recently, so I figured it would be a good thing to learn.

This site is currently a work in progress, but I have made it open source on my GitHub so you can see my progress as I work.
