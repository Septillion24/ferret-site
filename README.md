# Ferret site

link: https://septillion24.github.io/ferret-site/

*This is part of a long-term project I have been working on, where I work on a new project every week (to the best of my abilities). This was the project I worked on from **February 18th** to **February 25**. I do intend to go back and make this website more fleshed out in the future, but for now I must move on to my next project.

I created this site as a side project to work on outside of class for fun. This uses Svelte because it had been a while since I worked with any framework and I've been hearing many good things about it and it has been gaining popularity recently, so I figured it would be a good thing to learn.

This site is currently a work in progress, but I have made it open source on my GitHub so you can see my progress as I work.
